      <b>State</b> is a way to mannage the "state" of your application. It is the single source of truth and 
      holds the whole state tree. In truth, it is just an object. To change the state, you must 
      <b class="highlight">Commit</b> a mutation to it. For instance if you have a username inside your
      <b>View Controller</b>. And you display it as a heading in your template.

      Now if you update that name via a method inside your <b class="highlight">View Model</b>. This is all good, but 
      what happens when you <b class="highlight">change pages and come back?</b> The user's name that you changed with your 
      method got erased your <b>View Model</b>. This is where <b class="highlight">State</b> comes into 
      the picture!

      properties <b class="highlight">(state, getters, mutations, actions)</b>. Read more to find out what each

      The <b>context</b> is an object with access to your properties inside your <b>State Object</b>.
      It is passed to all methods inside your getters, mutations and actions. The <b>context</b> object allows you to get
      properties out of your <b>state</b> or call a method from your <b>mutations</b> or
      <b>actions</b>. Below is a table showing every property inside the <b>Context Object</b>.<br><br>

    <heading-sub heading="The State Object"></heading-sub>
    <div class="info">
      The <b>state</b> property is the main object of <b>variables/properties</b> in which you
      will be storing and minipulating data. For example you could add a property to the <b>state</b> called users.
      And this could be an array of user objects.
    </div>
    <img-comp src="./src/images/stateObject.jpg"></img-comp>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <heading-sub heading="The Getters Object"></heading-sub>
    <div class="info">
      The <b>getters</b> property will be an object of methods. The method's job is to <b class="highlight">get values out of your state</b>.
      For example, lets say you want to get the user james out of your array of users we showed you above.<br><br>

      You would create a <b>getter</b> method. Lets call it <b class="highlight">getUser()</b>. How do we access the
      state? Well, all getters get passed the <b class="highlight">previous state</b> and a payload that you set when calling a getter. 
      See the example below.
    </div>
    <img-comp src="./src/images/getters.jpg"></img-comp>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <heading-sub heading="The Mutations Object"></heading-sub>
    <div class="info">
      The <b>mutations</b> property holds all your methods <b class="highlight">that update or change</b> your state.
      Just like we explained above, all mutations get passed the <b>context</b> object, and a payload you set.<br><br>

      As an example, lets say you want to update the user within state called <b>"James"</b> to a name you pass
      in your <b>payload</b>. We would then create a <b class="highlight">mutation</b> with a name along the lines
      of <b class="highlight">"updateUser()"</b> which would do so. As you can see we decontruct the 
      <b>context object</b> only to use the state from it, See example below.
    </div>
    <warn-comp head="Note" text="All mutaions need to be synchronous to ensure that the state isnâ€™t dependent 
    on the timing and order of unpredictable (asynchronous) events."></warn-comp>
    <img-comp src="./src/images/commit.jpg"></img-comp>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <heading-sub heading="The Actions Object"></heading-sub>
    <div class="info">
      The <b>actions</b> property is very similar to the mutations property, but there is one key difference between
      a mutation method and an action method. All actions are for <b class="highlight">asynchronous</b> calls and should never 
      update or change the state itself. Rather you should call a mutation once you have the 
      <b class="highlight">asynchronous</b> data and pass it as a payload.<br><br>
      <!-- Therefore <b>actions</b> get passed a 3rd parameter called <b>done</b>. This is a <b>callback function</b> 
      which needs to be called once you are done with your changes to your <b>state</b>. This callback will 
      alert your <b>view</b> that changes have been made to your state and needs to <b>act accordingly</b>. -->

      For example, say we have a table in a <b class="highlight">database</b> which conatins all our users. Now we want to get a
      user and then insert him/her into our <b class="highlight">state</b>. Here is where an action will come into play. Lets call
      this action <b class="highlight">getUserFromDB()</b>, and fetch the user from our database. Once we get the user, we can
      call a <b class="highlight">mutaion</b> to insert the user we just got back. See example below.
